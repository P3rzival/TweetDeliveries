# TweetDeliveries
Project for my Software Engineering module at uni. The system would listen to a twitter account and handle orders from people's tweets.

- 📝 User creates an account on the website and puts his information. 
- 🍕 Whenever user feels hungry, he tweets the company saying the pizza he wants. 
- 🤖 The system automatically answers him and processes the order through the admin page where the chef can see what he needs to cook and the delivery man knows where the customer lives. 

Simple system integrated on ruby using Twitter's API (ruby-gem).
